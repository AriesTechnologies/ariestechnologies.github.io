		<h1>Overview</h1>
		<img src="../Images/SpartanOS/Manual/ADOBE.png" />
		<p>SpartanOS is built to be quick, lightweight, easy-to-use. There are multiple versions of SpartanOS. Most are not able to be used in the real world since one was built using the Scratch coding language and one was corrupted. It is alright though, because there is one planned to be released in 2019! All our operating systems are usually created based off each other so you usually don't have to uninstall and reinstall the new OS. Instead, we release updates to the old operating system version to prepare it to switch over to the new version which is then reflected in the operating system settings, design, etc. The only time we wouldn't be able to do this is when we change the programming language or if the last version gets corrupted (Thanks AtlasOS Discovery :) ). In 2019 AtlasOS was renamed to SpartanOS, all operating systems before 2019 are still called AtlasOS.</p>

		<h2>Operating Systems</h2>
		<h3>SpartanOS 2024 (2022):</h3>
		<p>This version of SpartanOS is being created as we speak. Go to Updates for more information.</p>
		<h3>SpartanOS Eclipse (2021):</h3>
		<p>This version of SpartanOS is in Beta as we speak. As of now we are working on the API for SpartanOS applications. Go to Updates for more information.</p>
		<h3>SpartanOS Ambition (2019):</h3>
		<p>This version of SpartanOS has been released as the first downloadable version of our operating system. The picture at the top of the page is what SpartanOS Ambition looks like.</p>
		<h3>AtlasOS Discovery (-):</h3>
		<p>This version of AtlasOS was deprecated near the beginning of creation due to unforeseen problems with how the boot sector was created and how the security worked. We decided that it would be best to retire the version name as a tribute to the AtlasOS programming team for working so hard on this version throughout 2018 even though it was never released.</p>
		<h3>AtlasOS Powercell (2017):</h3>
		<p>This version of AtlasOS was the second version of the operating system. It was built using the Python programming language and ran using Windows 10.</p>
		<h3>AtlasOS Scratch (2016):</h3>
		<img src="../Images/AtlasOSScratch.jpg">
		<p>This version of the operating system is the first version of AtlasOS ever! It was built using the Scratch programming language. It looked a lot like Windows 10.</p>
