		<h1>AtlasOS Scratch</h1>
		<img src="../Images/AtlasOSScratch.jpg" />
		<p>AtlasOS Scratch was the first operating system AtlasCorporations ever made! It was programmed in the Scratch programming language. It was a operating system that looked like Windows 10 but was pretty useless since it isn't able to be downloaded. It is still available online if you want to check out.</p>
