		<h1>AtlasDesigner 2.0 Released</h1>
		<img src="Images/AtlasDesigner3.png" />
		<p>AtlasCorporations has just released AtlasDesigner 2.0 which includes a ton of new improvements and features! Some of these new improvements and features are improved color averages to make the color more crisp and correct and fixed a bug that would crash the program sometimes when text in a certain size couldn't be rendered correctly. We also gave the program the ability to resize and adjust the image to make the image easier to use in the program.</p>
