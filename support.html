		<h1>Support</h1>
		<img src="Images/AriesTech.png" />
		<p>You can also get in touch with us here and keep up to date with what we are doing!</p>
		<p>Contact us on our Discord (AtlasCorporations)! Also please report any bugs you find! In your message please specify the application that this bug occurred on, what happened before the bug happened, and PLEASE specify the error number and error message if you are given one.</p>
		<h2>Atlas Beta Sign Up:</h2>
		<p>Atlas Beta is a program in which you can sign up to receive testing updates to all of AtlasCorporations and AtlasStudios applications. You don't actually have to test all the updates (since we also test them) but it is encouraged to test all the applications at some point during the trial period!</p>
		<p><i>AtlasBeta is only available for Discord members.</i></p>

		<h3>How do I get into creating my own video games?</h3>
		<p>Well I first learned Scratch (a visual programming language) and then Python since I was researching it on the internet and heard it was pretty simple to learn. I had some background in Java (that is what I learned in Computer Science) which helped slightly. I'm also currently learning C++. The one piece of advice I can give is practice. As they always say "Practice makes perfect!" which is very true in programming. If you want to learn how to program in Python I'll leave some links below to the videos I watched when I was learning.</p>

		<h3>Do you give AGFX out to the public?</h3>
		<p>No we don't give out AGFX to the public. It has only been in development since the start of Zombies II so it is fairly new and is still being updated. While it isn't released as its own application or module it is a part of SpartanOS Ambition and the improved version will be released as part of SpartanOS Eclipse which we are working on.</p>

		<h3>What is AGFX used for in Pygame?</h3>
		<p>AGFX is used to add objects that Pygame doesn't have already built in. Some of the main objects we have added in to AGFX that aren't in Pygame originally are buttons, menus, text displaying, LayeredGroups, OrderedGroups, and a bunch of other objects that are sometimes needed. We wanted to make an easy to use module to assist Pygame to make it easier for us to program the objects in our games. It also is able to grab internal statistics and display them using Pygame like FPS, display types, display sizes, and main modules.</p>

		<h3>Why are all your applications and games free?</h3>
		<p>We keep our games and applications free because most of the programming is done in our spare time and not as our first job. Plus we just like to see people have fun with our applications and games that we release. When we start our company we will decide pricing.</p>

		<h3>When will you release SpartanOS for beta testing?â€‹</h3>
		<p>SpartanOS Eclipse is currently in the works, we will release periodic gamma testing and beta testing updates. You can sign up for the updates by going to the Contact Us page and filling out the AtlasBeta form if you are a Discord member.
SpartanOS Eclipse IS NOT completely independent of other operating systems. It does require some other operating system to store data, run the program, and load images (to a certain degree). However, it is a mix between an operating system and an operating environment. Operating environments usually don't have a their own filesystem which is what makes ours different. We have our own filesystem that saves your data but since we can't communicate with the hardware that saves to your computer's storage device we export a binary file that is then handled by the actual operating system and is saved. We also don't have the ability to tell the computer to run our operating environment so it can't run by itself (but you have the ability to which we will show you how in a tutorial after the release). Although, you can make application and games for our operating system as long as you use Python and the AGFX/AWM package that comes with SpartanOS. We will work on making it able to read C/C++ so you can make games with that too.</p>

		<h3>Is SpartanOS Ambition released?</h3>
		<p>SpartanOS Ambition has been released.</p>

		<h3>How will I receive the game?</h3>
		<p>The game will be sent to you in a zipped file folder. To convert it to a regular folder right click on the folder and then click "Extract All". The directions from there on should be in a text file called README.txt.
Lastly all our games and apps (as of now) are absolutely FREE! NO in-app purchases either!</p>

		<h3>How many languages do you know/are learning?</h3>
		<p>I know: Python, HTML/CSS/JS, C#, C++</p>
		<p>Learning: Rust, V</p>
		<p>Dabble In: Lua, Batch, Java</p>
